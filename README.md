# Fake-News

My first project in php to create a newsfeed containing Fake News!

To view the project start by cloning it down to your own computer:
$ git clone https://github.com/Vstranne/Fake-News.git

Start a local php server:
$ php -S localhost:8000

Now all you have to do is write localhost:8000 in the adress field on your web browser.
